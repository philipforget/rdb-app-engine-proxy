A simple, memcached based throttling proxy for Readability's content API which can run on google app engin.

This runs on google app engine. It's also easy to run locally. You will need to have the ol' [python app engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/) runtime installed.

A sample is up at http://sample-rdb-proxy.appspot.com/

There is only one endpoint, root, which proxies requests to the readability content parser. There is one required parameter, `url` which must be a nicely escaped url e.g. http%3A%2F%2Fpaulgraham.com%2Fambitious.html%3Fsee_this_is%3Descaped.

Honestly if the url you are trying to parse doesn't have get params, you can leave it unescaped.

The second optional parameter is `callback` which lets you use this across domains using jsonp. Calls will be returned with content-type `application/javascript` if this parameter is passed and content will return like so:

```javascript
callback_value({...})
```

otherwise content will be returned as `application/json`.
